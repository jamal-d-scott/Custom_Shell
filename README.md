# Custom_Shell
Custom shell designed in C# with a few basic functions, and functions that I've created. This was practice for C# learning.
Provided: fortunes file for quotes, a sample "batch file" to read commands from, and a sample "code.txt" doc to show that the console and read and display a document.
To run the shell locally on your device, replace the System addresses to addresses that are native to your system: C:/Users/NAME/Directory/
